    <p>Hey, I am <strong>Chaoran Hu</strong>, a statistics Ph.D. student in University of Connecticut.</p>

    <p>It is not easy to find an accurate answer for this question, 'who are you'. Indeed, people always play different
    roles in life. In UConn Health Center, I am a biostatistics consultant. In UConn, I teach STAT3025: statistics models.
    When talking about research, I focus on stochastic process and I also develop some R packages.</p>
    
    <p>In life, pour-over coffee and country music are my hobby. Yiyun is my girlfreind.
    I have some freinds, also, but not a lot. I grow up in Anhui, a beautiful place with memory.
    Four years of youth were spent in Wuhan, to get a bachelor of science in math.
    Currently, I am living in Storrs, a tiny town with tender summer and bitter winter.</p>
